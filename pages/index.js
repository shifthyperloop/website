            Shift Hyperloop is an independent non-profit organization founded by
            students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)
            in Trondheim. We operate on a 1-year cycle where each year we enlist 
            a new team that are tasked with designing and building a hyperloop pod
            that will compete in the European Hyperloop Week (EHW).

            Hyperloop is a technology where a vehicle, called a "pod", moves
            through a tube with low air pressure by levitating over the tracks.
            This minimizes the friction losses, something that makes the
            technology very energy efficient. The technology will make it possible
            to transport humans and cargo at speeds of about 1000 km/h. That makes
            it possible to travel a distance equal to Oslo-Trondheim in under half
            an hour!

            European Hyperloop Week is the most important competition

            prove ourselves in competition against other hyperloop teams. 
            Itâ€™s hosted a different place in Europe every year, and in 2022 
            it will be hosted in the Netherlands.
