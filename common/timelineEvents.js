      'The other members will come with feedback and point out potential problems or improvements for the system.  If there is a query or technical abnormalities they will be rectified by the collaboration and openness between the team. It is a way for everyone to get important insight into the different systems, and a great way for the presenters to learn about potential problems with their concepts.\n' +

      'Often, they will learn about potential problems regarding integrating their solution with the other systems. Although it can be tense and tiring process, there is a lot of information to be exchange and without it wouldn’t be possible to finish our project. Through tough and difficult discussions our concept is finalized, and it was now possible to get a (somewhat) complete picture of what our team will be working on.',
